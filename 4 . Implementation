 Python program can be implemented by two ways

1)Interactive mode(Interpretive mode)
2)Batch mode


Interative(Interpertive mode)

* the concept of submmitiing one by one python statments explicitly in python interpreter
  >>>(command prompt of python)
* we use python shell for this purpose to pass command/statment line by line
* shell it is find in python software and also open by command prompt by passing command python(if path is set)
* it best when leaning predeined function ,operator uses,test differenct small code which used in any big application
* it make learning fast and easy
* it is not good for development mode


Batch(C/C++/java)
writing all statement and submit all statement to compiler--translate--passto ---â€¦

Character set:
    set of valid character in python programming language


                                   //set of character(a-z)/(A-Z)(0-9) +,-,*,/)
                                       Standard   code which equal to any character
                                        a=97(standcode code)  --->human-----information---computer
American----Standard code          for information interchange

                                        z=122(standard code
                                  //Computer 0101001(Binary)
    C---ASCII(256)----english language character only
    C++ASCII/UNICODE(65535)

                        python follow unicode(multiple language support)
