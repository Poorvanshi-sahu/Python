[9:10 PM, 12/11/2020] Sushil Sir C++: python program cabe be implemented by two ways

1)Interactive mode(Interpretive mode)
2)Batch mode


Interative(Interpertive mode)

* the concept of submmitiing one by one python statments explicitly in python interpreter
  >>>(command prompt of python)
* we use python shell for this purpose to pass command/statment line by line
* shell it is find in python software and also open by command prompt by passing command python(if path is set)
* it best when leaning predeined function ,operator uses,test differenct small code which used in any big application
* it make learning fast and easy
* it is not good for development mode

Character set:
    set of valid character in python programming language


                                   //set of character(a-z)/(A-Z)(0-9) +,-,*,/)
                                       Standard   code which equal to any character
                                        a=97(standcode code)  --->human-----information---computer
American----Standard code          for information interchange

                                        z=122(standard code
                                  //Computer 0101001(Binary)
    C---ASCII(256)----english language character only
    C++ASCII/UNICODE(65535)

                        python follow unicode(multiple language support)

//Datatype in python

   Static Typed language
   Datatype tell us type value(data),size in memory and range of value
                                  //  xxxx            // xxxx
   in static typed language  it must to define type of variable
   explicitly
   
       int       ino;

       float      fno;
	   
   Dynamic Typed Languages
   (python,javascript,php,perl)
   Where it is not required datatype to define explicitly,
   automatically understand/recognize by compiler itself
   by value you assign to variable

  python language support following datatypes
  1)int  <class,int>
  2)float <class,float>
  3)complex <class,complex>
  4)bool  <class,bool>
  5)str  <class,str>
  6)list <class,list>
  7)tuple <class,tuple>
  8)set  <class,set>
  9)dict <<class,dict>


Datatype:
	def:
		Every Datatype in python language is interally 
		implemented as class and create its object

python language datatypes are categorized into two types

they are:
	1.Fundamental types
	   int,float,complex,bool,str
	   
	   <class,int>
	2.Collection type
	   list,tuple,set,dict
	   
	
//Object type in python

1.Immutable object
  Object are not allowed to change once assign
  int,float,complex,bool,str,tuple
2.Mutable object
  Object are allowed to add and remove new elements
  list,set,dict
