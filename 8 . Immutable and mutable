[8:57 PM, 12/14/2020] +91 91716 46424: Immutable Objects

The objects which doesn't allow to  modify the contents of those objects 
are know as immutable objects

x=10 ---if object found in memory create new object  --by doesnt allow to modify same object
x=20 -----if object found in memory create new object ----by doesnt allow to modify same object
x=30  -----if object found in memory create new object -----by doesnt allow to modify same object

//when you assign value  either create new object or ref id of current value containg object

*Before creating immutable object with same content python interpreter verifies is already any object is
avaiable in memory
* if present in memory assign its id to reference variable

* if not present create new object and assign value , assign object id to reference variable

int,float,complex,boolean,string

** its slow but better memory management


mutable objects
 The object which allow to modify(add,remove/replace) the contents of those objects
 are know as mutable object(later we learn)
 tuple,list,set ,dict
